//In this second milestone a simple TCP setup with a client and server with basic send and recieve functions were created. Coding directly on the maze file, using the solution path pprovided, the array of tuples was sent to a senddata function alongside an empty array commandarr[] which is what we will send to the server. the senddata function subtracts the tuples in the solution array[i] with its previous tuple values to get a tuple value within the range of (x,y) {(-Width/n, -Height/n) -> (Width/n, Height/n)}, and based on value calculated a direction for the rover can be determined. Once the direction is calculated the corresponding string is appended into the commandarr array. Once the directions are complete, a stop string is appended and the commandarr is converted into bytes using pickle.dumps(). This byte data is sent to the SErver where it is reconvereted to a string printed out, and echoed back to the client after converting back into bytes. Then to ensure the data transfer was successful, the client recived the echo, converted back to a string and printed the array. Lastly, as added bonus, the senddata() function also printed out the solution directions to cross reference with the string values to ensure correct navigation. Important NOTE!: I was unsure as to how we were expected to look at the maze's navigation, so I defaulted to movement direction from a bird's eye perspective with controls like pacman, to move right left forward(down) and backward(up). I understand this would give me different results from navigating the maze from a rover perspective which would involve more steps such as turn left and then move forward to move into another square. Also I ran out of time to work on a buffering function to make it so a single string is sent every second, although I believe given a little more time it would not have been too difficult, but after pulling an all nighter the night before and collapsing on my keyboard for a few hours delaying my submission of my current work, I will leave that for another time.
